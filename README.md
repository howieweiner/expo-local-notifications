# Expo Local Notifications

This repo is an example of how to set up local notifications using [Expo](https://expo.dev/)

The app has been built using SDK 45

The app does not use push notifications

The app has been configured for notifications as per the [latest docs](https://docs.expo.dev/versions/latest/sdk/notifications/).

## Issues
- On Android, the notification does not show as a banner, only as an icon in the statusbar
- On Android, the statusbar icon remains after the notification has been dismissed
- On Android, when built, the icon shows in the statusbar, but not in the banner once revealed
